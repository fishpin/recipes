    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Use this basic scone dough for any sweet scone variety. 
        Feel free to increase the vanilla extract and/or add other flavor 
        extracts such as lemon extract or coconut extract. Read through the 
        recipe before beginning. You can skip the chilling for 15 minutes 
        prior to baking, but I highly recommend it to prevent the scones from over-spreading.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/2 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 1/2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1/2 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 - 1 1/2 cups add-ins</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk flour, sugar, salt, and baking powder together in a large bowl. Grate 
            the frozen butter using a box grater. Add it to the flour mixture and combine 
            with a pastry cutter, two forks, or your fingers until the mixture comes 
            together in pea-sized crumbs. See video above for a closer look at the texture. 
            Place in the refrigerator or freezer as you mix the wet ingredients together.</li>
        <li>Whisk 1/2 cup heavy cream, the egg, and vanilla extract together in a small bowl. 
            Drizzle over the flour mixture, add the add-ins, then mix together until everything 
            appears moistened.</li>
        <li>Pour onto the counter and, with floured hands, work dough into a ball as best you can. 
            Dough will be sticky. If it’s too sticky, add a little more flour. If it seems too dry, 
            add 1-2 more Tablespoons heavy cream. Press into an 8-inch disc and, with a sharp knife 
            or bench scraper, cut into 8 wedges. For smaller scones, press dough into two 5-inch 
            discs and cut each into 8 wedges.</li>
        <li>Brush scones with remaining heavy cream and for extra crunch, sprinkle with coarse sugar</li>
        <li>Place scones on a plate or lined baking sheet (if your fridge has space!) and refrigerate 
            for at least 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F</li>
        <li>Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper or silicone baking mat(s). If making mini 
            or drop scones, use 2 baking sheets. After refrigerating, arrange scones 2-3 inches apart on 
            the prepared baking sheet(s).</li>
        <li>Bake for 18-26 minutes or until golden brown around the edges and lightly browned on top. 
            Larger scones take closer to 25 minutes. Remove from the oven and cool for a few minutes. Feel 
            free to top with any of the toppings listed in the recipe Note below.</li>
    </ol>

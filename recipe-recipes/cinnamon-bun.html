        <li>3 tablespoons butter, softened</li>
        <li>3/4 cup powdered sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
     </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Warm milk to around 110 degrees F. Transfer warm milk
            to a bowl and sprinkle yeast on top. Add in sugar,
            egg, egg yolk and melted butter. Mix well with wooden
            spoon until dough begins to form.
        </li>
        <li>Knead dough for 8-10 minutes either by hand or with an
            electric mixer with a dough hook. Dough should for into
            a nice, slightly sticky ball. If too sticky, add more
            bread flour.
        </li>
        <li>
            Transfer dough to a well-oiled bowl, cover with plastic
            wrap and a warm towel. Allow dough to rise for 1 hour
            to 1 1/2 hours or until doubled in size.
        </li>
        <li>After dough has doubled in size, transfer to a well
            floured surface and roll into a 14x9 inch rectangle.
            Spread softened butter over rectangle, leaving a 1/4 inch
            margin at the far side of the dough.
        </li>
        <li>In a small bowl, mix together brown sugar and cinnamon.
            Sprinkle mixture over the buttered dough, then gently rub
            into the butter.
        </li>
        <li>Tightly roll dough up, starting from the shorter edge.
            Place roll seam side down, sealing edges as much as possible.
            Cut 1 inch of either side of the roll to ensure filling goes
            all the way to the edges.
        </li>
        <li>Using a serrated knife, cut roll into 1 inch sections. Place
            sections into a greased, lined 9x9 inch pan and leave to rise
            for 30-45 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Bake for 20-25 minutes or until
            edges are just golden brown. Let cool for 5-10 minutes before
            frosting.
        </li>
        <li>To make the frosting, combine cream cheese, butter, sugar and
            vanilla extract. Mix until light and fluffy.
        </li>
    </ol>
